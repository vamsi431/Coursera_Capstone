Roadside vendors, tea stalls, South Indian, North Indian, Muslim food, Chinese and Western fast food are all very popular in the city. Udupi restaurants, are very popular and serve as vegetarian cuisine. There are a varity of food and the food served in most of the restaurants are can be customised to cater to the tastes of the Indian population. visakhapatnam can also be called a Vizag."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# <h2>Problem description :</h2>"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Suppose i want to travel and keep changing places very frequently. This is very hectic and plus i get to experience of many different types of environment, of which i didnt have much knowledge about. In such situation, food can be an important factor for decided how you rate your trips and plus also recommmending it to the people. Food can also attract people around world to try it out if it were to be the best. In such scenarios, we need to find the right place, at reasonable cost, to serve us the best possible way. So there are few questions that must be addresed, such as :\n\nHow many types of foods are available in the restaurant ?,\n\nwhich is the most nearest to me with good rating ?,\n\nHow many \"similar\" restaurants are available near by me ?,\n\nDo the \"similar\" restaurants cost more ? if so, what speciality do that have ?\n\nTo address such question,company's manager decides to prepare this project to not just to find out solutions to the questions but also build a system that can help in recommending new places based on their rankings compared to the previously visited.\n\nExpectations from this recommender system is to get answer for the questions, and in such a way that it uncovers all the perspective of managing recommendations. It is sighted to show :\n\n1.What types of restaurants are present in a particular area ?\n\n2.where are the similar restaurant present based on a preference to particular food ?\n\n3.How do different restaurants rank with respect to my preferences ?"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Target audience :"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Target audiences for this project does not limit to a person who keeps travelling but everyone. People could simply decide to look for a similar restaurant all the time because they are addicted to a specific category of food. People who rarely use restaurants would prefer to have the most rated restaurants nearby them and all this could be easily handed by our recommender system. So target for this project is basically everyone who is exploring different places or similar places."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Success rate :"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "With restaurants evolving, new food categories comeup, combination of food starts to be more popular, we need a system that could help us access vast number of food varieties. It is impossible for a person to ask each and everyone about their visit to a particular place and also not all remembers everything. On the other hand, Computers are good at remembering things, and with Machine learning to its peak, it modren time technology will by our personal guidence and help us personally based on our likes and dislikes. So people would care about this project as their personal assistance and success rate could certainly increase with time."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Data requirements :"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "To find a solution to the questions and build a recommender model, we need data and lots of data. Data can answer question which are unimaginable and non answerable by humans because humans do not have the tendency to analyse such large dataset and produce analtics to find a solutions.\n\nLet's consider the base scenario :\n\nSuppose i want to find a restaurant, then logically, i need 3 things :\n\n1.Its geographical coordinates(latitide and longitude) to find out where exactly it is located.\n\n2.Population of the neighborhood where the restaurant is located.\n\n3.Average income of neighborhood to know how much is the restaurant worth.\n\nLets take a closer look at each of these :\n\nTo access location of a restaurant, its Latitude and Longitude is to be known so that we can point at its coordinates and create a map displaying all the restaurants with its labels respectively.\nPopulation of a neighborhood is very important factor in determining a restaurant's growth and amount of customers who turn up to eat. Logically, the more the population of a neighborhood, the more people will be interested to walk openly into a restaurant and less the population, less number of people frequently visit a restaurant. Also if more people visit, better the restaurant is rated because it is accessed by different people with different taste. Hence is is very important factor.\nIncome of a neighborhood is also very important factor as population was. Income is directly proportional to richness of a neighborhood. If people in a neighborhood earns more than an average income, then it is very much possible that they will spend more however not always true with very less probability. So an restaurant accessment is proportional to income of a neighborhood."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Data collection :"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Collecting geographical coordinates is not difficult but after searching it for more time, it was available on open source data websites such as wikipedia, india gov websit. So i decided to use Google maps API to fetch latitude and longitude but google API has limited number of calls that i could make with my free account. So it would take around days to fetch location of all the neighborhoods in visakhapatnam Initially i scrapped list of neighbor's using beautifulSoup4 from wikipedia. viskhapatnam has 121 neighborhoods. So i manually googled each neighborhood to find its corresponding latitude and longitude. After doing so, i produced the a dataframme.\n\nPopulation by neighborhood is again easy to find out given that its readily available. But incase of visakhapatnam, it is again not the easy. i was able to find population data for few cities. Rest other neighborhood population is assumed and may be inaccurate but since this is a demonstrating project, the main idea to get the working model. The dataframe for visakhapatnam neighborhood population looks high.\n\nIncome by neighborhood is again easy to find out given that its readily available. But incase of viskhapatnam, it is again the case. i was able to find Income data for main city.
